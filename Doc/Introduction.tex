\section{Introduction}
Welcome to the DualSense API for Windows documentation. This API will help you with integrating the Sony PS5 DualSense controller into your application or game for Windows. This document will guide you through the complete flow of integration, starting from a list of the DualSense controller's features, up to understanding every feature of this api.\\
The documentation is structured as follows:
